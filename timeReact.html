DOM Homework

I made a game that when users hit the start button, they wait for the blue button to turn red, then hit it. Then the time it took between the button turning red and the user hitting it appears with a message, and they can play again after. 

I have super limited knowladge on timers and buttons, so lots of sources int his one.

<!-- Class notes
Notice the “number” of the noun.
getElementById is singular. It returns a single object.
getElementsByClassName is plural. It returns an HTMLCollection of objects.

However You can use Array.from to create an Array based on an HTMLCollection
Be aware: an HTMLCollection is a “live” list: It will change as the DOM is updated, whereas an Array is a “static” list: It will not be updated.

buttons3[i].addEventListener('click', () => {
            let place = document.getElementById('group3-name');

            // buttons3[i] refers to the correct button because the scope of variable i
            // is limited to the body of the loop.  Thus, the current value of i is captured
            // by the closure of this lambda.
            console.log(`i is now ${i}`);
            place.innerText = buttons3[i].innerText;
        });

<h2> Timer </h2>
 <!-- Button to press -->

<button id="start">Start</button>
<h2 > Button to press here!</h2>
<button id="click-me" disabled>Click Me</button>

<!-- Time displayed -->
<p id="result"> No time yet! </p>
